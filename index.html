        <h2>My Journey into Tech</h2>
        <p>From my early days teaching at Kids Villa Junior School to gaining business communication skills through HP
            LIFE, every experience has fueled my passion for technology.</p>
        <p>I later joined Strathmore University's Digital Entreprenuership program, earned a Gold Certificate from
            Educate!, and enrolled at UICT Nakawa to persue a Diploma in Information Technology for Business.</p>
        <p>With each milestone - whether working at Airtel as a Customer Sales Representative or designing my first
            HTML/CSS profile card - I continue to grow and inspire.</p>
            <p>CodeQueen has opened my eyes to the world of technology. Through every session, I've grown from a beginner to a confident learner, building real projects and discovering my passion for digital skills. It's more than just code-it's about courage, creativity, and community. </p>
